# C-Phonebook
Author: Adam Carling

Description: This is a Phonebook programm that was created through coderunner. It allows you to enter names, edit names, and search names already entered. 

Instructions: There are two files that you will need to downlaod. the first is "phonebook.cpp." This file contains the actual code for the project. The second is the "phone.txt." This file is where the addresses, names, and numbers will be stored. make sure to download both and keep them in the same directory. Once installed, use a compiler to run the program and follow the steps it gives you to use the program. 

Inspiration for this project came from the need for a final project for a class. We were told to come up with a project non-game related. So I settled on this idea. All in all it turned out decent.
